# Catching moving fish game for cocos2dx

This game is POC to catch moving fish and I have been happy to open the source codes.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cable8mm/poc-moving-fish.git

cd pic-moving-fish
```

You must install cocos2d-x-2.2, and this sources put cocos2d-x's project folder then build it. That's all.

## Coding style

```sh
find . -name \* -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 clang-format -i
```
